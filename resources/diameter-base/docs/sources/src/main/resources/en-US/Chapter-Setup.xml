			<title>Hardware Requirements</title>
			<para>For optimal performance, the Resource Adaptor requires sufficient RAM memory and Java Heap size. For instance, while the underlying &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE may run with 1GB of RAM, 8GB is needed to achieve performance higher than 800 new requests per second.</para>
			<para>There is no minimum CPU specification. However, a fast CPU can  greatly contribute to the overall performance of your setup as more requests can be processed per second. </para>

				    	<para>Git is used to manage Mobicents JAIN SLEE source code. Instructions for downloading, installing and using Git can be found at <ulink url="http://git-scm.com/" /></para>
				    </important>
				    <para>Use Git to checkout a specific release source, the Git repository URL is &THIS.SOURCE_CODE_URL; , then switch to the specific release version, as explained in this example &THIS.VERSION;.</para>
				    <programlisting>
				    [usr]$ git clone &THIS.SOURCE_CODE_URL; mobicents-jain-slee-diameter

				    	<para>Maven 2.0.9 (or higher) is used to build the release. Instructions for using Maven2, including install, can be found at <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org" /></para>
				    </important>
				    <para>Use Maven to build the deployable unit binary as follows.</para>

				    [usr]$ cd resources/&THIS.RA.DIRNAME;
				    [usr]$ mvn install
				    </programlisting>
				    <para>Once the process finishes, you should have the <literal>deployable-unit</literal> jar file in the <filename>target</filename> directory. If &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE is installed and the environment variable JBOSS_HOME is pointing to the &JEE.PLATFORM; directory, then, the deployable unit jar will also be deployed in the container.</para>
