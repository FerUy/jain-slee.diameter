	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor</title>

	<para>This is a Resource Adaptor that provides a Diameter API for JAIN SLEE applications. It uses the Diameter Base protocol and it is responsible for managing connection between peers and providing an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework. It works with applications like network access and IP mobility, as defined by the the IETF <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3588">RFC 3588</ulink> protocol specifications.</para>
	<para>Events represent Diameter Base messages received by the Diameter stack. Different events types are specified for each Diameter request or answer. Events are activated either on client or on server activity.</para>
	<!--For peer management, the following messages are defined:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>Capabilities-Exchange-Request/Answer (CER/CEA, code: 257)</para>

	<para>In order to make efficient use of <acronym>RA</acronym>s, Activities are defined according to their corresponding <acronym>RA</acronym> Type. Activities represent Diameter session between two peers. <acronym>SLEE</acronym> applications use activities to create, send and receive messages.</para>
