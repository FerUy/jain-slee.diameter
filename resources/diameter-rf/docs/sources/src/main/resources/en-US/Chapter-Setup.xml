			<title>Hardware Requirements</title>
			<para>RAM and Java Heap size are very important with regards to Resource Adaptor. The more the RAM, the better the performance will be. For instance, while the underlying Mobicents JAIN SLEE may run with 1GB of RAM, 8GB is needed to achieve performance higher than 800 new requests per second</para>
			<para>Memory is only needed to store the Resource Adaptor state. Therefore, the faster the CPU, the more requests per second can be quickly processed. That said, there is no minimum specified CPU speed required to use the RA.</para>

<para>
The RA requires that &THIS.PLATFORM; is correctly set and that Mobicents Diameter Multiplexer (<acronym>MUX</acronym>), which includes the stack and the &THIS.PLATFORM; is correctly installed.

				    	<para>Git is used to manage Mobicents JAIN SLEE source code. Instructions for downloading, installing and using Git can be found at <ulink url="http://git-scm.com/" /></para>
				    </important>
				    <para>Use Git to checkout a specific release source. The Git repository URL is located at &THIS.SOURCE_CODE_URL;. Choose the desired release version as can be seen in the following example &THIS.VERSION;.</para>
				    <programlisting>
				    [usr]$ git clone &THIS.SOURCE_CODE_URL; mobicents-jain-slee-diameter

				    	<para>Maven 2.0.9 (or higher) is used to build the release. Instructions for using Maven2, including install, can be found at <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org" /></para>
				    </important>
				    <para>Use Maven to build the deployable unit binary.</para>
				    <programlisting>
				    [usr]$ cd resources/&THIS.RA.DIRNAME;
				    [usr]$ mvn install
				    </programlisting>
				    <para>Once the build is completed, you should have the <literal>deployable-unit</literal> jar file in the <filename>target</filename> directory, if &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE is installed and environment variable JBOSS_HOME is pointing to its underlying &JEE.PLATFORM; directory, then the deployable unit jar will also be deployed in the container.</para>

			<para>The procedure is similar to <xref linkend="release_source_building"/>, the only change is the Git reference should be the <literal>master</literal>. The <literal>git checkout tags/&THIS.VERSION;</literal> command should not be performed. If already performed, the following should be used in order to switch back to the master:</para>
